🧑‍💻 Context Note

This project was developed by a recent graduate of the Technology Program in Systems Analysis and Development, based on academic content broadly aligned with international Computer Science curricula.

It addresses common performance issues experienced by Windows users, such as system slowdown caused by the accumulation of temporary and unnecessary files. The goal is to apply technical knowledge to deliver an accessible and functional solution for everyday users, with no affiliation to any organization.

As the project evolves, parts of the documentation will be gradually translated into English to increase technical reach and support international understanding.

# 🧩 Introduction

This project was developed to address real-world challenges faced by users with limited technical expertise, aiming to deliver a practical and accessible system optimization tool.

The Easy Clean Mate GUI system is designed to meet this need. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface that facilitates system cleaning and maintenance, contributing to improved performance and usability. The solution promotes digital autonomy and enhances the computing experience for non-technical users.

## ❗ Problem

> _How can non-technical users improve their computer performance through a simple and accessible system cleaning tool?_

Many individuals face slow system performance caused by the accumulation of temporary and unnecessary files. While technical solutions exist, they are often complex, intimidating, or inaccessible to users without advanced knowledge. This gap creates a need for a user-friendly tool that empowers people to maintain their systems independently.

## 🎯 Objective

### General Objective 
To develop a graphical user interface (GUI) system that enables non-technical users to clean and optimize their computers easily and effectively.

### Specific Objectives
- To identify the main performance issues caused by temporary and unnecessary files.
- To design a user-friendly interface tailored to the needs of non-technical users.
- To validate the system’s usability and effectiveness through testing with representative users.

## 💬 Rationale

Many users—both domestic and professional—experience frustration with sluggish computers but lack the technical expertise to resolve these issues. Existing tools are either too advanced or not intuitive enough for this audience.

This project is justified by the opportunity to promote digital inclusion through a solution that simplifies system maintenance. By offering a graphical interface tailored to non-technical users, the Easy Clean Mate GUI contributes to autonomy, usability, and improved digital experiences.

## 📈 Expected Impact

The system aims to improve the digital experience of users by reducing wait times, increasing productivity, and extending the lifespan of their devices. By simplifying system maintenance, it empowers individuals and small businesses to manage their technology more effectively.

## 🏘️ Partner Description

The “EasyClean Community” represents a fictional group of home and professional users who face challenges with computer performance due to file clutter. These users typically lack advanced technical skills and seek simple, effective solutions to optimize their systems. The Easy Clean Mate GUI system was created to meet this demand, offering a clean and intuitive interface for system maintenance.
